# Hotel B and B Website, Wildland Cottage

A basic static HTML website for a Bed and Breakfast Cottage which also has basic Javascript for the reviews and image gallery.
The website was created during the Web Development Module of Year One of my degree.

## Getting Started and Installation

As the website is static HTML, it can either be viewed here or the ZIP can be downloaded.
If the ZIP is downloaded then please open the index with your preffered web browser.
