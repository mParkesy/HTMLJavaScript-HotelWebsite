						From surfing to vineyards, there’s lots to see and do in the Kingsbridge area. The estuary provides plenty of opportunities if you’re a water sports enthusiast, while the town has a thriving arts and crafts community for the more laid back visitor. Coast or countryside, Kingsbridge has a choice of scenic walking and hiking routes suitable for every level of ability.
						Kingsbridge is a vibrant town, with a varied selection of shops, cafes, restaurants and pubs open all year. The major crowd pulling events in town are the Food and Music Festival, held in June and Fair Week in July.					
					</p>
					<p>
						Twice a month a Farmers Market is held in the town, giving you the chance to pick over freshly, locally grown produce with not a cellophane wrapper in sight.<br>
						If you want to catch a film check out the independent Reel Cinema in the town. Behind the old-fashioned façade you’ll find 3 screens, multiplex seating and the chance to see blockbusters alongside something a little more avant-garde.
					</p>
					<h3 class="clear">An Island of Adventure</h3>
					<p class="clear">
						The area is popular with walkers and water sports enthusiasts. Close by is Bigbury beach, where at low tide you can walk across the sand to Burgh Island, the setting for the Agatha Christie novel ‘Evil under the Sun’. At high tide a sea tractor can take you across – a trip not to be missed, and especially popular with young children, which gives you the perfect excuse to stay on the island a little longer by sampling the hospitality offered at The Pilchard Inn. The beaches here are also a magnet for surfers, with lessons and board hire available for all abilities.
					</p>
					<h3 class="clear">Fantastic local produce on the doorstep</h3>
					<p class="clear">
						If plants and gardens are more your thing then pop over to Fast Rabbit Farm and Gardens. Set in 30 acres of the Strawberry Valley, it offers good accessibility and the chance to pick up a floral reminder of the day in the attached plant shop.<br>
						Nearby Aune Valley Meat is an award winning butchers, deli and farm shop. If you’re giving yourself the day off cooking then enjoy their wares at their café – their ‘butchers breakfast’ is a great way to prepare for a day exploring.
					</p>
					<h3 class="clear">Shops</h3>
					<p class="clear">
						For a small town, Kingsbridge has a wide range of shops including bookshops, charity shops, antique shops, clothes shops, gift and craft shops and a Tescos superstore.<br>
						There are also two petrol stations (Kingsbridge's Co-op and a 24hr Texaco) in Kingsbridge and several car repair companies should your car develop a fault during your stay.
